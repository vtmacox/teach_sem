## Lavaan

- `lvaan` is a package in **R** that is designed for structural equation modeling. 

- You can use this even if you aren't an **R** expert

- It offers a lot of modeling options that are comparable to Mplus

- Lots of great resources to learn `lavaan`
    + http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/index.html<br />
    <br />
    
- Down sides
    + Can't do multilevel models
    + Can't do mixture models
    + Can't do bayesian (use `blavaan` with `lavaan`)
    
## Data 

We will be using the `PoliticalDemocracy` data from the `lavaan` package, so we start by loading the package.

```{r load_package}
#install.packages("lavaan")
library(lavaan)

```



## Specify the model (figure)

Below is any a model from the `lavaan` tutorial website.  You can see that there are three latent variables, one with three indicators and two with four indicators. Additionally, we've specified the hypothesized causal order.

```{r, out.width= "600px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("sem-1.png")
```

## CFA

### Specify CFA for latent variables

The first step for fitting and SEM model is to fit each individual CFA model for each latent variable.  We can easily do this in `lavaan`.  

The first step is to specify each of the inividual CFA models.

```{r cfa}

cfa1 <- '
    ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3'

cfa2 <- '
    dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4'

cfa3 <- '
    dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8'

cfa_all <- '
    ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
    dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
    dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8'

```

### Fit CFA models

The next step in `lavaan` is to fit the models we specified above. We do this by using the `cfa()` function from `lavaan`.

```{r cfa_fit}

fit_cfa1 <- cfa(model = cfa1, data = PoliticalDemocracy)

fit_cfa2 <- cfa(model = cfa2, data = PoliticalDemocracy)

fit_cfa3 <- cfa(model = cfa3, data = PoliticalDemocracy)

fit_cfa_all <- cfa(model = cfa_all, data = PoliticalDemocracy)

```

Above we are using two arguments from the `cfa()`.  The first is `model` which we set equal to the model we specified above.  The second argument is the `data`.


### Output CFA results


Lastly, we get the output by using the `summary()` function.  Because we have the `lavaan` package loaded, **R** knows to use the `lavaan` version `summary()`.  If you didn't have `lavaan` loaded, the `summary()` function wouldn't work properly.

```{r cfa_output}

summary(fit_cfa1, fit.measures = TRUE)

summary(fit_cfa2, fit.measures = TRUE)

summary(fit_cfa3, fit.measures = TRUE)

summary(fit_cfa_all, fit.measures = TRUE)

```

## SEM Model

### Specify the model (code)


```{r model_syntax}

model <- '
  # measurement model
    ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
    dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
    dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8
  # regressions
    dem60 ~ ind60
    dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60
  # residual correlations
    y1 ~~ y5
    y2 ~~ y4 + y6
    y3 ~~ y7
    y4 ~~ y8
    y6 ~~ y8
'

```

### Fit the model

```{r fit}

fit <- sem(model, data = PoliticalDemocracy)

```

### Get output

```{r output}

summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)

```
